            the world of sorcery after he ate a Cursed Object: a finger
            belonging to Ryomen Sukuna, a powerful Cursed Spirit—a being
            manifested from Cursed Energy from the negative emotions flowing
            from humans. With his classmates, Yuji exorcises Curses while trying
            to honor his grandfather's legacy and save others unconditionally so
            that when he is executed after eating all twenty fingers, he will

            exceptional Cursed Techniques are developed as he faces down
            different Curses and the emotional blowback of his actions. Despite
            having only practiced using Cursed Energy for a few months, Yuji is
            tremendously powerful even without having become Sukuna's
            Vessel.Yuji also has strong durability, being able to walk off stab
            wounds and beatings.
