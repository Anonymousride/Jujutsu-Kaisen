                    Yuji Itadori is a fictional character and the main protagonist of
                    the manga series Jujutsu Kaisen created by Gege Akutami. Yuji is a
                    first-year Jujutsu Sorcerer at Tokyo Jujutsu High who is thrown into
                    the world of sorcery after he ate a Cursed Object: a finger
                    belonging to Ryomen Sukuna, a powerful Cursed Spirit—a being
                    manifested from Cursed Energy from the negative emotions flowing
                    from humans. With his classmates, Yuji exorcises Curses while trying
                    to honor his grandfather's legacy and save others unconditionally so
                    that when he is executed after eating all twenty fingers, he will
                    not be alone in his death.Throughout the series, Yuji and
                    exceptional Cursed Techniques are developed as he faces down
                    different Curses and the emotional blowback of his actions. Despite
                    having only practiced using Cursed Energy for a few months, Yuji is
                    tremendously powerful even without having become Sukuna's
                    Vessel.Yuji also has strong durability, being able to walk off stab
                    wounds and beatings.

                    Suguru Geto is a fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga
                    Jujutsu Kaisen 0. Suguru Geto is a powerful sorcerer who was
                    previously friends with Satoru Gojo. He seeks the Queen of Curses
                    Rika Orimoto, who in turn is searching for the protagonist of the
                    prequel series, Yuta Okkotsu. Geto also appears in the main series
                    Jujutsu Kaisen series which, through flashbacks, further explores
                    his friendship with Gojo and their eventual antagonism towards one
                    another. In the main series, his corpse is controlled by Kenjaku
                    (Japanese: 羂索, Hepburn: Kenjaku), an ancient sorcerer who uses the
                    Cursed Technique of transplanting his brain into other bodies.
                    Kenjaku's goal is to evolve humanity through Cursed Energy to create
                    a new golden age of Jujutsu sorcery similar to the Heian
                    period.Shinobu Sensui, an antagonist from Yoshihiro Togashi's manga
                    series YuYu Hakusho, inspired Akutami to create Geto, wanting also
                    to explore prejudice through his character.

                    Yuta Okkotsu is the protagonist of Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu
                    Kaisen 0. He is a teenager who is surrounded and helped by the
                    Cursed Spirit of Rika Orimoto, his childhood friend who died six
                    years before the story and is cursed because both of them promised
                    to get married when they grow up. In November 2016, Yuta met Satoru
                    Gojo, a Jujutsu Sorcerer under whose guidance he joined Tokyo
                    Metropolitan Curse Technical School to control Rika's Curse. Yuta
                    also appears in the sequel Jujutsu Kaisen as an experienced
                    warrior.Akutami created Yuta alongside Rika before the creation of
                    Jujutsu Kaisen 0 as a duo who work together. He compared Yuta with
                    the Jujutsu Kaisen protagonist Yuji Itadori, whose roles in the
                    narratives are similar because having to deal with inner beings with
                    different personalities.Yuta was met with a positive response. Some
                    critics found him more appealing than the protagonist Yuji Itadori
                    due to their different powers and backstories.
